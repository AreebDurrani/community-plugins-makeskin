# MakeSkin

MakeSkin is a tool for creating materials for MakeHuman. It is intended for uses where more advanced settings are needed,
as opposed to the rather primitive materials written by MakeClothes. 

It is also intended to cater for production of skin materials, something which was never supported by MakeClothes. 

## Current status

This tool is as of yet pre-alpha and is not really usable for any real-world scenario. You will only want to download 
this if you intend to participate in the development.
